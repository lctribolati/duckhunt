This is a reproduction of Duck Hunt, a notorious arcade game created by Nintendo for NES console.
The code was created using Java in collaboration with a friend of mine for an University exam.

Inside the src folder you can find the duckhunt package, which contains the DuckHunt.java file (main). 
To run the game click run inside the DuckHunt.java file or use the DuckHunt.jar file provided inside the dist folder.

We used all the original icons and sounds. The game consists in trying to catch the flying duck shooting at it, considering
that the speed is incrementally increasing with rounds. There is not a limit in how far you can go with rounds, though the game
was thought to last around 7-8 rounds.

Enjoy!
